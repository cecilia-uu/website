## Writeup
### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
The most challenging part is to make this design perfect on mobile, as I can easily adjust it on the laptop. CSS is hard to use for me as I dislike to adjust the style. 6 hours.

### What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
Adjust the height and weight of the header and footer. Add the overflow-y: auto property to the main section. Make the content of main section to show 100% by adding the property - max-width: 100%.

### What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
I added the feature of downloading the resume. In addition, the recruiters can directly email by clicking the email address. Lastly, I order my projects to make more unser friendly.

### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
Add the icon of the website. Add the dynamic demo image of the project. Showcase my skills by giving different icons.

### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
More than 6 hours. It's longer than what I expected.

### (Optional) If you made any assumptions about this assignment, what are they?
